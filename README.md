Hammersmith 0.27.0
==================

A Scala-based, asynchronous Netty driver for MongoDB with type-class based fast custom object encoding.

Stays crunchy in milk!

DISCLAIMER
-----------
This driver is still an early beta and should be used with caution in production.  It still lacks support for crucial
features such as Replica Sets.

There is also a known (but completely adorable!) issue where occasionally, an exception is thrown that causes a litter of pug puppies to burst forth from any open USB ports on your computer.  You have been warned.

**PRODUCED IN A FACILITY WHICH ALSO PROCESSES JAVA AND/OR FEZ'**
